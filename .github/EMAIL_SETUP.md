# 📧 GitHub Native Notification Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up notifications for your daily Playwright test results using GitHub's built-in notification system.

## 🎯 How It Works

Instead of using SMTP email servers, this setup uses GitHub's native notification system:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Daily test results are automatically posted as GitHub issues
2. **Email Notifications**: You receive emails through GitHub's notification system
3. **No SMTP Setup**: No need for email passwords or server configuration

## 🔔 Enable Email Notifications

### Step 1: Watch the Repository

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **Watch** button (top right)
3. Select **All Activity** to get notifications for all issues

### Step 2: Configure Your GitHub Notification Settings

1. Go to [GitHub Notification Settings](https://github.com/settings/notifications)
2. Under **Email notification preferences**:
   - ✅ Enable **Issues**
   - ✅ Enable **Comments on Issues and Pull Requests**
3. Choose your preferred email frequency

### Step 3: Optional - Set Email Recipients Variable

If you want to track who should receive notifications:

1. Go to Repository **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
2. Click **Variables** tab
3. Add a variable named `EMAIL_RECIPIENTS` with value: `email1@domain.com,email2@domain.com`
